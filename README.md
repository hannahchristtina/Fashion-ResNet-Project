# Fashion Image Classification with Transfer Learning using ResNet
To accurately classify images of clothing by fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model, avoiding the need to train a complex model from scratch.

# Technologies
Google Colab: Provides a free GPU for training.
PyTorch/torchvision: The framework for building and using the neural network.
ResNet18: The pre-trained model used for transfer learning.

# Dataset
The FashionMNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images across 10 clothing categories.
